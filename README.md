# Short-Circuiting

## Description

The topic we would like to review is the concept of short-circuiting. The purpose of this mini-project will be to define short-circuiting in a way to help students understand the concept of it, learn how to use it, and how it is important in coding. The project will go over definitions, previous examples, and new examples that demonstrate this topic. In class, we went over short-circuiting with examples such as multiplying with zero; we plan on altering this example to use a different method: division.
